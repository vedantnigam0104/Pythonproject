 Write a program to read the contents of both the files created in the above programs and merge the contents into “merge.txt”. Avoid using the close() function to close the files.

def program3():
    with open("MyFile.txt","r") as f1:
       data=f1.read()
    with open("intro.txt","r") as f2:
        data1=f2.read()
    with open("merge.txt","w") as f3:
        f3.write(data)
        f3.write(data1)
program3()
