Highest Common Factor or Greatest Common Divisor of two or more integers when at least one of them is not zero is the largest positive integer that evenly divides the numbers without a remainder. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.
We have two integers 8 and 12. Let's find the HCF.

The divisors of 8 are:

1, 2, 4, 8  
The divisors of 12 are:

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12  
HCF /GCD is the greatest common divisor. So HCF of 8 and 12 are 4.
# defining a function to calculate HCF  
def calculate_hcf(x, y):  
    # selecting the smaller number  
    if x > y:  
        smaller = y  
    else:  
        smaller = x  
    for i in range(1,smaller + 1):  
        if((x % i == 0) and (y % i == 0)):  
            hcf = i  
    return hcf  
  
# taking input from users  
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))  
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))  
# printing the result for the users  
print("The H.C.F. of", num1,"and", num2,"is", calculate_hcf(num1, num2))
