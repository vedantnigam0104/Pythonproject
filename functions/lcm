LCM stands for Least Common Multiple. It is a concept of arithmetic and number system. The LCM of two integers a and b is denoted by LCM (a,b). It is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both "a" and "b".
Multiples of 4 are:

4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36,... and so on...  
Multiples of 6 are:

6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42,... and so on....  
Common multiples of 4 and 6 are simply the numbers that are in both lists:

12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72,.... and so on....  
LCM is the lowest common multiplier so it is 12.
