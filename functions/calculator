In Python, we can create a simple calculator for performing the different arithmetical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Approach:
We can choose the desired operation from the option of a, b, c, and d.
We can take two numbers, and if… elif… else, branching is used for executing the particular operation.
We will use add(), subtract(), multiply() and divide() function for evaluation the respective operation in the calculator.
Example:

Please select operation -  
a. Add  
b. Subtract  
c. Multiply  
d. Divide  
Select operations form a, b, c, d: "c"    
Please enter first number: 11  
Please enter second number: 4  
11 * 4 = 44  
Code: for Simple Calculator

def add(P, Q):    
   # This function is used for adding two numbers   
   return P + Q   
def subtract(P, Q):   
   # This function is used for subtracting two numbers   
   return P - Q   
def multiply(P, Q):   
   # This function is used for multiplying two numbers   
   return P * Q   
def divide(P, Q):   
   # This function is used for dividing two numbers    
   return P / Q    
# Now we will take inputs from the user    
print ("Please select the operation.")    
print ("a. Add")    
print ("b. Subtract")    
print ("c. Multiply")    
print ("d. Divide")    
    
choice = input("Please enter choice (a/ b/ c/ d): ")    
    
num_1 = int (input ("Please enter the first number: "))    
num_2 = int (input ("Please enter the second number: "))    
    
if choice == 'a':    
   print (num_1, " + ", num_2, " = ", add(num_1, num_2))    
    
elif choice == 'b':    
   print (num_1, " - ", num_2, " = ", subtract(num_1, num_2))    
    
elif choice == 'c':    
   print (num1, " * ", num2, " = ", multiply(num1, num2))    
elif choice == 'd':    
   print (num_1, " / ", num_2, " = ", divide(num_1, num_2))    
else:    
   print ("This is an invalid input")
